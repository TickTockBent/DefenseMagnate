# Defense Magnate

A real-time arms manufacturing management game built with React, TypeScript, and Vite. Players run an arms manufacturing company in a fractured galactic warzone, managing production workflows, machine assignments, materials, and contracts in real-time.

## üéÆ Game Overview

Defense Magnate is a browser-based management simulation where you:
- **Manufacture weapons and components** using realistic machine workspace systems
- **Manage real-time production** with 1 minute = 1 game hour time scale  
- **Optimize machine utilization** with facility-wide job queues and dynamic assignment
- **Handle multiple product lines** with different manufacturing methods
- **Watch jobs flow** through machines automatically with visual progress indicators
- **Get real-time feedback** with job completion notifications and activity spinners

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Architecture

### **Technology Stack**
- **Frontend**: React 18 with functional components and hooks
- **State Management**: Zustand for reactive game state
- **Styling**: TailwindCSS with ASCII-based design system
- **Build System**: Vite with TypeScript strict mode
- **Type System**: Comprehensive TypeScript with barrel exports

### **Code Organization**
```
src/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ components/          # UI components and panels
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ constants/           # Game enums and constants
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/               # Static game data and equipment definitions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ state/              # Zustand game state management
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ systems/            # Core game logic (production scheduler, etc.)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ types/              # TypeScript type definitions (barrel exported)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils/              # Utility functions and formatters
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ types/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.ts        # Barrel export for all types
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ game.ts         # High-level game state composition
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ future.ts       # Type definitions for planned features
```

### **Key Architectural Patterns**
- **Barrel Exports**: Single import point for all types (`import { ... } from '../types'`)
- **Consolidated Enums**: All game enums in `constants/enums.ts`
- **Dynamic Capacity Calculation**: Equipment capabilities calculated from installed tools
- **Real-Time Job Scheduling**: Production scheduler manages equipment allocation
- **Constraint-Based Manufacturing**: Tag requirements naturally limit production

### **Recent Refactoring (Manufacturing v1)**
- **Import/Export Cleanup**: Eliminated fragile individual type imports
- **Relaxed TypeScript Config**: Reduced import friction while maintaining type safety
- **Future-Proofed Types**: Added comprehensive type definitions for planned systems
- **Equipment-Driven Capacity**: Removed hardcoded values, now calculated from equipment

## üöÄ Development

### **Setup**
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### **Available Commands**
```bash
npm run dev          # Development server
npm run build        # Production build
npm run preview      # Preview production build
npm run lint         # Code linting (when configured)
npm run typecheck    # TypeScript checking (when configured)
```

### **Game Testing**
The game starts with a garage equipped with:
- Basic hand tools, workbench, and storage
- Manual lathe and mill for machining operations
- Starter materials for testing all manufacturing methods
- Sufficient capacity to manufacture basic sidearms immediately

### **Manufacturing Testing**
Three basic sidearm manufacturing methods available:
1. **Forge Method**: Make pristine weapons from steel + plastic
2. **Restore Method**: Repair damaged weapons with spare parts
3. **Cobble Method**: Assemble junk-quality weapons from scrap

## üéØ Current Status

**Manufacturing v1 Pass: ‚úÖ COMPLETE**

The core manufacturing system is fully implemented and functional. Players can:
- Start production jobs immediately with pre-equipped garage
- Experience real-time manufacturing with equipment constraints
- Test all manufacturing methods with provided materials
- See live production progress and bottleneck analysis
- Understand equipment requirements through constraint tooltips

The game is ready for the next development pass focusing on materials and supply chain management.

## üîÆ Vision

Defense Magnate aims to be a deep, engaging management simulation that combines:
- **Realistic manufacturing constraints** that feel intuitive and strategic
- **Real-time progression** that respects player time while staying engaging
- **Complex systems** presented through clean, understandable interfaces
- **Meaningful choices** in equipment, contracts, and business strategy
- **Rich discovery mechanics** that reward curiosity and experimentation

The game will eventually expand to Steam via Electron/Tauri wrapper while maintaining its browser-first design philosophy.
