# Dynamic Workflow Generation - Backwards Planning with Uncertainty

## Core Concept: Backwards Planning with Discovery

The dynamic workflow system works **backwards from the desired outcome** while adapting to **discovered conditions** as work progresses. Unlike static recipes, the workflow evolves based on what's actually found during disassembly and inspection.

## Universal Workflow Pattern

### **Phase 1: Goal Analysis**
- **Target Product**: What the player wants to end up with
- **Current Inventory**: What materials and components are available
- **Gap Identification**: What needs to be acquired, manufactured, or restored

### **Phase 2: Backwards Decomposition**
Working backwards from the target product:
- **Tier 3 Products**: Identify required sub-assemblies and shaped components
- **Tier 2 Components**: Identify required raw materials and preparation steps
- **Tier 1 Materials**: Identify procurement or processing needs

### **Phase 3: Uncertainty Management**
For items with unknown conditions:
- **Inspection Operations**: Generate assessment steps for condition discovery
- **Conditional Branching**: Plan multiple possible paths based on inspection results
- **Adaptive Replanning**: Modify workflow as conditions are discovered

## The Repair Workflow Example

### **Initial Analysis**
- **Goal**: Functional Basic Sidearm
- **Available**: 1x Basic Sidearm [damaged]
- **Strategy**: Restore existing item rather than manufacture new

### **Backwards Planning**
```
Functional Basic Sidearm requires:
├─ 1x Mechanical Assembly [functional]
├─ 1x Small Tube [functional]  
└─ 1x Small Casing [functional]

Current Status: Unknown (hidden in damaged sidearm)
Next Step: Disassembly and inspection required
```

### **Workflow Generation with Uncertainty**
1. **Disassembly Operation**: Extract sub-components from damaged sidearm
2. **Inspection Operation**: Assess condition of each extracted component
3. **Conditional Planning**: Generate response plans for each possible condition

## Condition Discovery and Adaptation

### **Inspection Results Drive Workflow**
After disassembly inspection reveals:
- **Small Tube**: [functional] 85% quality → Use as-is
- **Small Casing**: [damaged] 35% quality → Replace with new
- **Mechanical Assembly**: [damaged] 40% quality → Further disassembly needed

### **Adaptive Replanning**
System automatically adjusts workflow:
- **Small Tube**: No action needed
- **Small Casing**: Generate plastic molding operation
- **Mechanical Assembly**: Trigger recursive disassembly workflow

## Recursive Disassembly Logic

### **Tier 3 Item Assessment**
When a damaged Tier 3 item is discovered:
1. **Disassembly Check**: Can this item be disassembled into sub-components?
2. **Economic Analysis**: Is disassembly more cost-effective than replacement?
3. **Recursive Planning**: If disassembling, apply same workflow logic to sub-components

### **Mechanical Assembly Breakdown**
```
Damaged Mechanical Assembly requires:
├─ 10x Mechanical Components [rough] [functional]

Disassembly inspection reveals:
├─ 6x Mechanical Components [rough] [functional] → Keep
├─ 3x Mechanical Components [rough] [damaged] → Replace  
├─ 1x Mechanical Components [rough] [corroded] → Recondition or replace

Workflow adapts:
├─ Keep 6 functional components
├─ Manufacture 3 replacement rough components
├─ Assess reconditioning viability for corroded component
```

## Condition-Specific Processing

### **Status Tag Response**
The system automatically inserts appropriate treatment operations:

#### **[corroded] Components**
- **Assessment**: Determine corrosion severity
- **Treatment Options**: Chemical cleaning, surface restoration, replacement
- **Equipment Check**: Verify treatment equipment availability
- **Cost Analysis**: Treatment cost vs replacement cost

#### **[jammed] Mechanisms**
- **Disassembly**: Careful breakdown to identify jam source
- **Cleaning**: Remove debris or contamination
- **Lubrication**: Restore smooth operation
- **Reassembly**: Rebuild with improved clearances

#### **[water-damaged] Electronics**
- **Drying**: Controlled moisture removal
- **Corrosion Assessment**: Check for electrical damage
- **Component Testing**: Verify continued functionality
- **Replacement Planning**: Source replacement electronics if needed

## Universal Application Pattern

### **Any Tier 3 Item Repair**
1. **Disassemble** → Extract sub-components into job inventory
2. **Inspect** → Assess condition of each sub-component  
3. **Categorize** → Functional (keep), damaged (process), unusable (replace)
4. **Process Damaged** → Apply reconditioning or recursive disassembly
5. **Manufacture Missing** → Create replacement components as needed
6. **Reassemble** → Rebuild complete item from processed components

### **Any Manufacturing Job**
1. **Decompose** → Identify all required components and materials
2. **Inventory Check** → Determine what's available vs needed
3. **Gap Analysis** → Plan acquisition or manufacturing for missing items
4. **Dependency Resolution** → Ensure all prerequisites are met
5. **Execution Planning** → Generate optimal operation sequence

## Workflow Monitoring and Adaptation

### **Real-Time Condition Discovery**
- **Progressive Revelation**: Item conditions discovered as work progresses
- **Workflow Updates**: System adjusts remaining operations based on discoveries
- **Resource Reallocation**: Materials and equipment reassigned as needed

### **Economic Optimization**
- **Cost Tracking**: Monitor actual costs vs estimates as work progresses
- **Decision Points**: Present options when multiple viable paths exist
- **Efficiency Learning**: System learns from outcomes to improve future estimates

## Benefits of Backwards Planning

### **Realistic Manufacturing**
- **No Magical Knowledge**: System doesn't know item conditions until inspection
- **Adaptive Problem Solving**: Responds to actual conditions rather than assumptions  
- **Authentic Discovery**: Players experience the uncertainty of real restoration work

### **Scalable Complexity**
- **Simple Items**: Straightforward workflows with minimal uncertainty
- **Complex Items**: Multi-level disassembly with condition-dependent processing
- **Any Scale**: Same logic applies from simple repairs to complex restorations

### **Emergent Gameplay**
- **Surprise Discoveries**: Valuable components found in junk items
- **Economic Decisions**: Repair vs replace based on actual conditions
- **Learning Experience**: Players develop intuition for restoration economics

## Implementation Considerations

### **Job Inventory Management**
Each workflow job maintains its own inventory space where:
- **Disassembled Components**: Stored temporarily during processing
- **Intermediate Products**: Held between operations
- **Condition Assessments**: Results tracked with components
- **Resource Allocation**: Materials reserved for workflow completion

### **Uncertainty Handling**
The system manages unknown outcomes through:
- **Probabilistic Planning**: Estimate likely scenarios with confidence levels
- **Branching Operations**: Prepare multiple response paths
- **Dynamic Rescheduling**: Adjust workflow as conditions are revealed
- **Resource Buffering**: Maintain material reserves for unexpected needs

### **Workflow State Management**
Each active workflow tracks:
- **Current Phase**: Which operations are complete vs pending
- **Discovered Conditions**: Actual component states found during work
- **Adaptive Changes**: How workflow has evolved from initial plan
- **Economic Progress**: Actual costs vs estimates throughout process

## Integration with Job System

### **Workflow to Job Translation**
Each generated workflow operation becomes a discrete job in the existing job management system:

**Workflow Operation**:
```
Operation: "Chemical Treatment - Small Tube"
Duration: 30 minutes
Inputs: 1x Small Tube [corroded], Cleaning chemicals
Equipment Required: Chemical Bath Station
Worker Skill: Basic
Output: 1x Small Tube [functional]
```

**Translated to Job System**:
- **Job Type**: Standard machine operation
- **Equipment Allocation**: Chemical Bath Station
- **Material Consumption**: Cleaning chemicals (at operation start)
- **Material Production**: Improved Small Tube (at operation completion)
- **Duration**: 30 minutes
- **Worker Assignment**: Basic skill level required

### **Job Dependency Management**
- **Sequential Dependencies**: Assembly jobs wait for prerequisite component jobs
- **Conditional Dependencies**: Inspection results determine which subsequent jobs are needed
- **Resource Dependencies**: Jobs only start when required materials are available
- **Equipment Dependencies**: Jobs queue until required equipment becomes available

### **Clean Break from V1 System**
The new dynamic workflow system completely replaces static manufacturing methods:
- **No Predefined Recipes**: All workflows generated dynamically based on goals and available resources
- **Adaptive Planning**: Workflows change based on discovered conditions
- **Universal Logic**: Same workflow generation principles apply to any manufacturing task
- **Unified Interface**: All manufacturing actions use the same dynamic workflow system

This backwards planning approach with uncertainty management creates authentic manufacturing workflows that adapt to real conditions, providing the foundation for sophisticated repair, restoration, and manufacturing gameplay at any scale.
