# Manufacturing V2 Arc - Dynamic Manufacturing Intelligence

## Overview

Manufacturing V2 transforms Defense Magnate from recipe-based production to an intelligent manufacturing system that adapts workflows based on item condition, available components, and player capabilities. Building on the component-driven foundation from the Disassembly v1 arc, this system introduces dynamic job planning, optional enhancement modifiers, and condition-aware manufacturing.

## Core Evolution

### From Static Recipes to Dynamic Intelligence
**Current System**: Predefined manufacturing methods with fixed inputs and outputs
**V2 System**: Intelligent analysis of inputs with dynamic workflow generation

**Example**: Instead of separate "restore damaged sidearm" and "forge new sidearm" methods, the system analyzes the available inputs and automatically generates the optimal manufacturing workflow.

### Intelligent Manufacturing Decisions
The system will:
- **Analyze item condition** and determine salvageable components
- **Calculate material gaps** between available and required components
- **Generate optimal workflows** to bridge those gaps
- **Apply condition-specific treatments** when needed
- **Offer enhancement options** based on available technology and skills

## Dynamic Workflow Generation

### Condition Assessment System
When a manufacturing job is initiated, the system performs intelligent analysis:

**Input Analysis**:
- Scan all selected items for condition, quality, and special status tags
- Determine which components can be salvaged vs need replacement
- Identify any special treatment requirements ([drenched], [corroded], etc.)

**Gap Analysis**:
- Calculate component requirements for final product
- Compare against available salvageable components
- Determine minimum manufacturing needed to fill gaps

**Workflow Generation**:
- Create custom operation sequence based on actual needs
- Insert treatment operations for special conditions
- Optimize operation order for efficiency

### Example: Dynamic Restoration
**Player Action**: Start "Basic Sidearm" job with 1x Basic Sidearm [damaged] [drenched] as input

**System Analysis**:
1. **Condition Assessment**: Item is water-damaged, requires drying and rust treatment
2. **Disassembly Prediction**: Estimates 3 salvageable rough components, 1 precision component, casing unusable
3. **Gap Calculation**: Need 4 more rough, 4 more precision, 1 new casing
4. **Treatment Requirements**: Requires drying and rust removal for salvaged components

**Generated Workflow**:
1. **Drainage & Assessment** (20min) - Remove water, assess corrosion damage
2. **Disassembly** (15min) - Carefully extract salvageable components
3. **Rust Treatment** (45min) - Chemical treatment for recovered components
4. **Rough Milling** (53min) - Mill 4 additional rough components from steel
5. **Precision Turning** (47min) - Turn 4 additional precision components
6. **Casing Formation** (28min) - Mold new plastic casing
7. **Assembly** (25min) - Combine all components (3 salvaged + 8 new)
8. **Final Assembly** (15min) - Install mechanism in new casing
9. **Quality Control** (10min) - Test restored weapon

**Total Time**: ~258 minutes (vs 183 for standard restore method)
**Materials**: 0.7 steel, 0.5 plastic, rust removal chemicals
