- **Market value calculations** for enhanced products with profitability preview

### How to Test Phase 1:
1. **Start a Basic Sidearm job** - Select "Smart Manufacturing (basic_sidearm)" method
2. **Try with different inputs** - Use with damaged sidearms, raw materials, or empty inventory
3. **Observe dynamic behavior** - The system will generate different workflows based on what's available
4. **Check hierarchy compliance** - No steel can be "disassembled" back to scrap steel
5. **Material preparation** - Steel will be properly prepared into billets before component creation

### How to Test Phase 2:
1. **Select a manufacturing method** - Choose any Basic Sidearm or Tactical Knife method
2. **Look for Enhancement section** - Should appear below method description if equipment unlocks any
3. **Select enhancements** - Check boxes for desired enhancements and see real-time cost/benefit analysis
4. **Start enhanced job** - Job will carry enhancement data and apply quality/market value bonuses
5. **Check profitability** - Green = profitable, yellow = marginal, red = unprofitable enhancements

## Overview

Manufacturing v2 represents a **revolutionary paradigm shift** from static recipe-based manufacturing to an intelligent, inventory-driven production system that:

### **Core Revolution: Infinite Scalability**
Instead of predefining every possible manufacturing scenario ("clean watery rifle", "heat-damaged corroded knife"), the system **intelligently analyzes any item in any condition** and generates appropriate workflows automatically.

**Example**: Finding a water-damaged rifle crate:
- **OLD SYSTEM**: Need predefined "repair_watery_rifle" job 
- **NEW SYSTEM**: System detects [drenched, damaged] tags ‚Üí generates drying + repair workflow automatically

### **Key Capabilities**:
- **Inventory-Driven Intelligence**: Analyzes what you have, suggests what you can do
- **Automatic Workflow Generation**: Creates repair, disassembly, and treatment operations on-demand  
- **Condition-Aware Processing**: Handles any combination of status tags intelligently
- **Enhancement Integration**: Phase 2 enhancement system seamlessly integrated
- **Infinite Product Support**: Tree-based interface scales to thousands of products
- **Contract Intelligence**: Matches inventory to customer requirements automatically
- **Research Integration**: Products and enhancements unlock through discovery and technology progression

### **Technical Foundation**:
- **Three-tier manufacturing hierarchy** with logical assembly/disassembly boundaries
- **Dynamic operation generation** based on item tier, condition, and available equipment
- **Equipment-based capability discovery** for enhancements and alternative methods
- **Scalable UI architecture** supporting complex workflows and large product catalogs

## Manufacturing Hierarchy Framework

### Core Design Principle: Clear Assembly/Disassembly Boundaries

Manufacturing v2 implements a logical three-tier hierarchy that eliminates conceptual inconsistencies:

#### **Tier 1: Raw Materials (Atomic)**
- **Cannot be disassembled** - These are pure, unprocessed materials
- Examples: `steel`, `aluminum`, `plastic`, `titanium`
- Obtained through: Mining, purchasing, recycling

#### **Tier 2: Shaped Materials (Processed from Raw Materials)**
- **Cannot be disassembled** - These ARE the raw material, just shaped/processed
- **Can be further shaped** - Can undergo additional processing steps
- Examples: `steel-billet`, `steel-sheet`, `plastic-rod`, `aluminum-stock`
- Manufacturing stages: `mechanical-component-rough`, `mechanical-component-precision`, `blade-blank`, `blade-finished`

#### **Tier 3: Assemblies (Combinations of Components)**
- **CAN be disassembled** - These are multiple parts joined together
- Examples: `mechanical-assembly`, `knife-handle`, `basic-sidearm`, `tactical-knife`
- Disassemble into: Their constituent shaped materials and sub-assemblies

### Manufacturing Operation Types

```typescript
enum OperationType {
  SHAPING = 'shaping',        // Raw ‚Üí Shaped OR Shaped ‚Üí Better Shaped
  ASSEMBLY = 'assembly',      // Components ‚Üí Assembly  
  DISASSEMBLY = 'disassembly' // Assembly ‚Üí Components (reverse of assembly only)
}

enum ItemManufacturingType {
  RAW_MATERIAL = 'raw_material',      // Steel, aluminum, plastic
  SHAPED_MATERIAL = 'shaped_material', // Steel billet, precision component
  ASSEMBLY = 'assembly'               // Mechanical assembly, sidearm
}
```

### Manufacturing Flow Examples

#### **Valid Manufacturing Paths**:
```
steel ‚Üí steel-billet (preparation/shaping)
steel-billet ‚Üí mechanical-component-rough (rough machining)
steel-billet ‚Üí mechanical-component-precision (precision machining)
mechanical-component-rough + mechanical-component-precision ‚Üí mechanical-assembly (assembly)
mechanical-assembly + plastic-casing ‚Üí basic-sidearm (assembly)
```

#### **Valid Disassembly Paths**:
```
basic-sidearm ‚Üí mechanical-assembly + plastic-casing (disassembly)
mechanical-assembly ‚Üí mechanical-components (various types) (disassembly)
STOP - Components cannot be disassembled (they ARE steel, just shaped)
```

#### **Enhanced Realism Through Preparation**:
- Steel must be prepared into appropriate billets for specific products
- Different products require different billet preparations
- Billet preparation is a necessary manufacturing step that enhances verisimilitude
- Players understand they're shaping materials, not arbitrarily creating/destroying matter

## Phase 3: Intelligent Job Creation Interface (Combined 3+4)

**Core Philosophy**: Replace static recipe selection with intelligent, inventory-driven operation discovery that scales infinitely and handles any item condition automatically.

### 3.1 Inventory-Driven Action Discovery
**Goal**: Automatically detect valid operations for any item in any condition

**Revolutionary Approach**:
Instead of predefining every possible state ("clean watery rifle", "heat-damaged corroded knife"), the system intelligently analyzes items and generates appropriate workflows:

```typescript
// OLD WAY (Doesn't Scale)
predefinedJobs = [
  "basic_sidearm_forge_new",
  "basic_sidearm_repair_damaged", 
  "basic_sidearm_clean_watery",
  "basic_sidearm_repair_corroded_watery",
  // ... thousands of combinations
]

// NEW WAY (Infinite Scalability)
const actions = InventoryActionDiscovery.analyzeItem(item);
// Returns: [repair, disassemble, clean, refurbish, scrap] based on actual condition
```

**Key Systems**:
- `systems/inventoryActionDiscovery.ts` - Detects valid operations for any item
- `systems/automaticWorkflowGeneration.ts` - Creates repair/disassembly workflows on-demand
- `systems/conditionTreatmentPlanner.ts` - Handles [drenched], [corroded], [heat-damaged] automatically

### 3.2 Two-Panel Job Creation Interface
**Goal**: Scalable UI that handles thousands of products and complex workflows

**Left Panel: Product & Action Selection**

- **Inventory Actions**: Context-sensitive operations for items in storage
- **Search & Filters**: Find products quickly in large catalogs
- **Dynamic Categories**: Tree built from BaseItem definitions, scales infinitely

**Right Panel: Job Configuration & Preview**
- **Operation Preview**: Complete workflow visualization before starting
- **Enhancement Integration**: Enhancement system from Phase 2
- **Cost/Benefit Analysis**: Materials, time, and profitability preview
- **Smart Recommendations**: System suggestions for efficiency and profit

### 3.3 Automatic Operation Generation
**Goal**: Generate repair, disassembly, and treatment operations automatically

**Repair Operations**:
```typescript
// System analyzes damaged sidearm and generates:
RepairWorkflow {
  1. Disassembly (15min) ‚Üí Components analysis
  2. Condition Treatment (30min) ‚Üí Clean [drenched] parts  
  3. Component Replacement (45min) ‚Üí Replace broken parts
  4. Final Assembly (35min) ‚Üí Rebuild complete weapon
  
  Materials: 0.7 steel, 0.3 plastic
  Time: 2h 5min
  Cost: 45cr ‚Üí Value: 180cr ‚Üí Profit: 135cr
}
```

**Disassembly Operations**:
```typescript
// System reads assembly definition and creates reverse workflow automatically
DisassemblyWorkflow {
  1. Careful Disassembly (20min) ‚Üí Preserve component quality
  2. Component Sorting (5min) ‚Üí Categorize by condition
  3. Cleaning Operations (15min) ‚Üí Remove [drenched] tag if needed
  
  Expected Recovery: 1x Mechanical Assembly [functional], 1x Small Tube, 1x Small Casing
  Component Value: 95cr vs Intact Value: 120cr
}
```

**Treatment Operations**:
```typescript
// Automatic condition handling - no predefined "watery rifle" jobs needed
TreatmentWorkflow {
  DetectedConditions: [drenched, corroded]
  GeneratedTreatments: [
    1. Drying Process (45min) ‚Üí Remove [drenched] tag
    2. Corrosion Removal (60min) ‚Üí Remove [corroded] tag  
    3. Quality Assessment (10min) ‚Üí Determine final condition
  ]
  EquipmentRequired: [heating_station, chemical_bath]
  RiskFactors: [15% chance component_degradation, 5% chance treatment_failure]
}
```

### 3.4 Intelligent User Experience
**Goal**: Transform manufacturing from recipe-following to production planning

**User Workflow Examples**:

**Scenario: Water-Damaged Rifle Crate**

3. **Repair Preview**: Shows drying ‚Üí disassembly ‚Üí component replacement ‚Üí reassembly
4. **Batch Option**: "Process all 12 rifles together? (saves 3 hours via parallel processing)"
5. **Enhancement**: "Add corrosion resistance? (+25min each, +35cr value each)"

**Scenario: Unknown Component Analysis**
1. **Component Discovery**: Player finds "Mysterious Mechanical Assembly [functional]"
2. **Compatibility Analysis**: "Can be used in: Basic Sidearm, Advanced Rifle, Plasma Weapon"
3. **Action Options**: üî¨ Disassemble for components, üì¶ Use in assembly, üîç Analyze design
4. **Value Comparison**: "Worth 45cr as parts vs 120cr if used in Basic Sidearm"

    // Reverses assembly definition to create disassembly operations
  }
}

class ConditionTreatmentPlanner {
  static generateTreatmentSequence(conditions: ItemTag[]): TreatmentOperation[] {
    // Handles [drenched], [corroded], [heat-damaged] etc automatically
  }
}
```
